			<p>Classes are group by grade level:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>⁃ Pre­K and Kindergarden</li>
			<li>⁃ 1st and 2nd grade</li>

			<li>⁃ 3rd and 4th grade</li>

			<li>⁃ 5th and 6th grade</li>

			<li>⁃ 7th and 8th grade</li>

			<li>⁃ 9th­12th grade</li></ul>

			<p> “But Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid

			them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven’” (Matthew 19:14). Our

			children are the future of the church, which is why we want to instill in

			them the correct faith, dogma, rites, and traditions of the Coptic

			Orthodox faith. Our goal is for the children to have a personal

			relationship with Jesus Christ, and for them to grow up spiritually to

			become true disciples.</p>
