			<p>The way to build a relationship with God is to talk to him through prayer. The prayer meeting is a combination of spiritual songs, agpeya, and individual prayers.</p>
			<p>Saint Augustine said, "Prayer is the key of heaven, the protection of our souls, the source of all virtues, the ladder which ascends us to God, the work of angels, and the foundation of faith." Prayer is also the way of repentance.  As Saint Isaac has said, "Whoever thinks that there is another way for repentance rather than prayer is deceived by Satan."  A great promise made by our Lord Jesus Christ himself reads, "whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." Matthew 21:22</p>
