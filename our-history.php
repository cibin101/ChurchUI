			The Coptic Church or the Church of Alexandria is called "See of 

			St. Mark", one of the earliest of four sees: Jerusalem, Antioch, 

			Alexandria, and Rome.</p>

			<h4>About the Founder, St. Mark</h4>

			<p>The Copts are proud of the apostolicity of their Church, whose 

			founder is St. Mark; one of the seventy Apostles (Mk 10:10), and one 

			of the four Evangelists. He is regarded by the Coptic hierarchy, as the 

			first of their unbroken 117 Patriarchs, and also the first of a stream of 

			Egyptian martyrs.</p>

			<p>This apostolicity was not only furnished on grounds of its foundation, 

			but rather by the persistence of the Church in observing the same 

			faith received by the Apostle and his successors, the Holy Fathers.</p>

			<h4>St. Mark's Biography</h4> 

			<p>St. Mark was an African native of Jewish parents who belonged to the 

			Levites' tribe. His family lived in Cyrenaica until they were attacked 

			by barbarians, and lost their property. Consequently, they moved to 

			Jerusalem with their child John Mark (Acts 12:12, 25; 15:37). He was 

			given a good education and became conversant in both Greek and 

			Latin in addition to Hebrew. His family was highly religious and in 

			close relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

			<p>His cousin was St. Barnabas and his father's cousin was St. Peter. 

			His mother, Mary, played an important part in the early days of the 

			Church in Jerusalem. The upper room in her house became the first 

			Christian church in the world where the Lord Jesus Christ Himself 

			instituted the Holy Eucharist (Mk 14:12-26). Also, this is the same 

			place where the Lord appeared to the disciples after His resurrection 

			and His Holy Spirit came upon them.</p>

			<p>Young Mark was always associated with the Lord, who choose him 

			as one of the seventy. He is mentioned in the Holy Scriptures in a 

			number of events related with the Lord. For example, he was present 

			at the wedding of Cana of Galilee, and was the man who had been 

			carrying the jar when the two disciples went to prepare a place for the 

			celebration of the Passover (Mk 14:13-14; Lk 22:11).</p>

			<h4>St. Mark and the Lion</h4>

			<p>The voice of the lion is the symbol of St. Mark for two reasons:</p>

			<p>1. He begins his Holy Gospel by describing John the Baptist as a 

			lion roaring in the desert (Mk 1:3).</p>

			<p>2. His famous story with lion, as related to us by Severus Ebn-El-
			Mokafa: Once a lion and lioness appeared to John Mark and 

			his father Arostalis while they were traveling in Jordan. The 

			father was very scared and begged his son to escape, while he 

			awaited his fate. John Mark assured his father that Jesus Christ 

			would save them and began to pray. The two beasts fell dead 

			and as a result of this miracle, the father believed in Christ.<p>

			<h4>Preaching with the Apostles</h4>

			<p>At first, St. Mark accompanied St. Peter on his missionary journeys 

			inside Jerusalem and Judea. Then he accompanied St. Paul and St. 

			Barnabas on their first missionary journey to Antioch, Cyprus and 

			Asia Minor, but for some reason he left them and returned home 

			(Acts 13:13). On their second trip, St. Paul refused to take him along 

			because he left them on the previous mission; for this reason St. 

			Barnabas was separated from St. Paul and went to Cyprus with his 

			cousin St. Mark (Acts 15:36-41). There, he departed in the Lord and 

			St. Mark buried him. Afterwards, St. Paul needed St. Mark with him 

			and they both preached in Colosse (Col 4:10), Rome (Phil 24; 2 Tim 

			4:11) and perhaps in Venice.</p>

			<h4>In Africa</h4>

			<p>St. Mark's real labor lay in Africa. He left Rome to Pentapolis, back to 

			where he was born. After planting the seeds of faith and performing 

			many miracles he traveled to Egypt, through the Oasis, the desert of 

			Libya, Upper Egypt and then entered Alexandria from its eastern gate 

			in 61 A.D.</p>

			<p>On his arrival, the strap of his sandal was loose. He went to a shoe 

			cobbler to mend it. When the cobbler - Anianos - took an awl to work 

			on it, he accidentally pierced his hand and cried aloud "Oh One God". 

			At this utterance, St. Mark rejoiced and after miraculously healing the 

			man's wound, took courage and began to preach to the hungry ears 

			of his convert. The spark was ignited and Anianos took the Apostle 

			home with him. He and his family were baptized, and many others 

			followed.</p>

			<p>The spread of Christianity must have been quite remarkable because 

			pagans were furious and fought St. Mark everywhere. Sensing 

			danger, the Apostle ordained a Bishop (Anianos), three Priests and 

			seven Deacons to look after the congregation if anything befell him. 

			He left Alexandria to Berce, then to Rome, where he met St. Peter 

			and St. Paul and remained there until their martyrdom in 64 A.D.

			Upon returning to Alexandria in 65 AD, St. Mark found his people 

			firm in faith and thus decided to visit Pentapolis. There, he spent two 

			years preaching and performing miracles, ordaining bishops and 

			priests, and winning more converts.</p>

			<p>Finally, he returned to Alexandria and was overjoyed to find that 

			Christians had multiplied so much that they were able to build a 

			considerable church in the suburban district of Baucalis.</p>

			<h4>His Martyrdom</h4>

			<p>In the year 68 AD, Easter fell on the same day as the Serapis 

			feast. The furious heathen mob had gathered in the Serapis temple 

			at Alexandria and then descended on the Christians who were 

			celebrating the Glorous Resurrection at Baucalis. St. Mark was 

			seized, dragged with a rope through the main streets of the city. 

			Crowds were shouting "the ox must be led to Baucalis," a precipitous 

			place full of rock where they fed the oxen that were used in the 

			sacrifice to idols. At nightfall the saint was thrown into prison, 

			where he was cheered by the vision of an angel, strengthening him 

			saying, "Now your hour has come Mark, the good minister, to receive 

			your recompense. Be encouraged, for your name has been written 

			in the book of life." When the angel disappeared, St. Mark thanked 

			God for sending His angel to him. Suddenly, the Savior Himself 

			appeared and said to him, "Peace be to you Mark, my disciple and 

			evangelist!" St. Mark started to shout, "Oh My Lord Jesus" but the 

			vision disappeared.</p>

			<p>On the following morning probably during the triumphal procession of 

			Serapis he was again dragged around the city till death. His bloody 

			flesh was torn, and it was their intention to cremate his remains, but 

			the wind blew and the rain fell in torrents and the populaces disperse. 

			Christians stole his body and secretly buried him in a grave that they 

			had engraved on a rock under the altar of the church.</p>

			<h4>His Apostolic acts</h4>

			<p>St. Mark was a broad-minded Apostle. His ministry was quite 

			productive and covered large field of activities. These include:</p>

			<p>1. Preaching in Egypt, Pentapolis, Judea, Asia Minor, and Italy 

			during which time he ordained Bishops, Priests, and Deacons.</p> 

			<p>2. Establishing the "School of Alexandria" which defended 

			Christianity against philosophical school of Alexandria and 

			conceived a large number of great Fathers. </p>

			<p>3. Writing the Divine Liturgy of the Holy Eucharist which was 

			modified later by St. Cyril to the Divine Liturgy known today as 

			the Divine Liturgy of St. Cyril.</p>
