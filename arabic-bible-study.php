			<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ himself set an example

			regarding the importance of reading and studying the word of God

			since his childhood when “they found him in the temple sitting in the

			midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them

			questions” (Luke 2:46). Let us be like the congregation of Berea who

			“received the word with all readiness, and searched the searched the

			scriptures daily” (Acts 17:11).</p>
